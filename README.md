# Weather Chatbot üå§Ô∏è

A smart weather chatbot built with Streamlit that answers weather-related questions using real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands weather questions in natural language
- **Location-based Weather**: Get weather for any city or location worldwide
- **Current Weather & Forecasts**: Provides both current conditions and multi-day forecasts
- **Smart Intent Detection**: Only responds to weather-related questions
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Clean, user-friendly Streamlit chat interface

## How It Works

1. **Question Analysis**: The bot analyzes your question to determine if it's weather-related
2. **Location Extraction**: Extracts location information from your question
3. **Weather Data Retrieval**: Fetches real-time weather data using Open-Meteo API
4. **Response Generation**: Formats and presents the weather information in a readable format

## Example Questions

### Current Weather
- "What's the weather in Paris?"
- "How's the temperature in Tokyo today?"
- "Is it raining in London?"

### Weather Forecasts
- "Show me the forecast for New York this week"
- "Weather forecast for Sydney"
- "Will it rain in Mumbai tomorrow?"

### Non-Weather Questions
The bot will politely decline to answer non-weather questions with: "I can answer only weather questions."
